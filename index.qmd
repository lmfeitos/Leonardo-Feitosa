Hello, I'm Leo! I'm a Brazilian biologist passionate about using research to achieve a sustainable use of natural resources. I'm especially interested in wildlife trade, fisheries, and species conservation (especially sharks and rays). Outside of work, I really enjoy traveling, cooking tasty meals for family and friends, and reading fiction and non-fiction books.
